============================

Practice app for trying out networking and general Android development.

### Current Goal:
-----
1. User sign up (I guess we can use a postgres or mysql database for this. I think postgres is the hot new thing but it's whatever).
2. User sign up will allow us to store a device ID (The database can be stored on my server for practice)
3. I think this device ID can be used to communicate from one user to another through the app and push notifications
4. Create a "room" where two people can be invited to
5. Have it be one persons turn.
6. Have a button in this room that changes colors or something or we could just start with sending a message to the other player for now.
7. Have the other person get a push notification that it is their turn now and take them to the screen that shows the message for now.
They can enter a response and this goes on ad infinitum.

### Eventual Goal:
-----
1. Cool asynchronous multiplayer android game wish push notifications.
2. ???
3. Profit.
